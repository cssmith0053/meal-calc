Meal calculator is a program I coded as part of an assignment for Programming I, which allowed the user to enter the price of a meal and the percentage they'd like to tip, and from that, it'd calculate the total cost of said meal using Florida's general state sales tax. It being Programming I, the program was relatively trivial. However, now that it's Programming II, my partner Angel Vera and I hope to breathe new life into this program by giving it an object-oriented spin, adding exception handling, the ability to select any state, not just Florida, for the sales tax rate, and possibly even a GUI.
